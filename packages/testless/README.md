  Gatsby's default starter + Tailwind CSS
</h1>

Kick off your project with this default boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React. In addition, you get a sensible Tailwind CSS configuration, with a bunch of (opinionated) goodies.

_Have another more specific idea? You may want to check out Gatsby's vibrant collection of [official and community-created starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/)._

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying this starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using this starter
    gatsby new my-tailwind-starter https://github.com/mjsarfatti/gatsby-starter-tailwind-opinionated
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-tailwind-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-tailwind-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in this Gatsby / Tailwind project.

    .
    ├── .vscode
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .eslintrc
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    ├── postcss.config.js
    ├── README.md
    ├── tailwind.config.js
    └── yarn.lock

1. **`/.vscode`**: This directory contains two files: `extensions.json` and `settings.json`. The first is a list of recommended extensions to make working with this project a breeze. The second essentially tells VS Code to run `eslint` on save.

2. **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

3. **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

4. **`.eslintrc`**: This is a configuration file for [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). ESLint is a tool to help you write good JavaScript.

5. **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

6. **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

7. **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

8. **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

9. **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

10. **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

11. **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

12. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

13. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

14. **`postcss.config.js`**: This is a configuration file for [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/). PostCSS is a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript, and it is used by Tailwind CSS.

15. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

16. **`tailwind.config.js`**: This is a configuration file for [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

17. **`yarn.lock`**: This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. This file is generated in place of `package-lock.json` if you use **yarn** instead of **npm**. You may safely delete one of the two. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

## ✨ Goodies

- Sensible Tailwind config with defaults that most projects use and bonus transition easings and box shadows (see `tailwind.config.js`)
- Auto-purge and minify CSS file on build
- Absolute imports (this means you can import files as `src/components/Header` from everywhere in your codebase, and avoid `../../../../../components/Header` messes)
- Run `prettier` through `eslint` on save if you use **VS Code** and install the recommended extensions
- Typescript-ready out of the box
- **Create React App** `eslint` preset with `eslint-plugin-import` to prevent issues with misspelling of file paths and import names

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
