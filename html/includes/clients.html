              I care about the user experience first and foremost. Is the feature still working? SEO configured
              correctly? Now I can actually write the integration tests with no extra effort.

              Our team loves the tight integration with Git. Engineers can focus on writing and delivering code while
              testless ensures the quality. Tests can be recorded by everyone. No training required.

              In the past, we had to write &amp; maintain test manually. Tests were flakky. testless is much more
              reliable and abstract a lot of noise away.
              We can focus now on what to test, not on the how.
